# Melanoma-Detection-Case-Study
Creating a possible model to detect melanoma from the dataset accurately.


## Problem statement: 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Solution approach:-
I used Augmentor to create more samples of the image classes.
I used normalization.
I used Dropout layers to tacke model overfitting.

## Final Solution observation:-
Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
The latest Model is fitting better than the previous ones.
The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
